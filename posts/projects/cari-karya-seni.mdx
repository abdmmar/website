After completed a course from Dicoding, Belajar Fundamental Front-End Web
Development, that teach you about concept that used in front-end field, how to
use Webpack to bundle the code, and create a component using Web Component so
the code can be used as a component and used it accross the page, etc. I think
it's interesting to try some popular framework/library in JavaScript, so I
choose React and took
[Complete Intro to React, v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/)
by Bryan Holt from FrontendMasters. So this is it, Cari Karya Seni, my first
ever React project. Cari Karya Seni is web application to dind popular art
from the Harvard Art Museum.

### Lesson Learned

Here's my lesson learned while developing this project:

- **Learn how to fetch the data in React**

  I learned how to get data and populate the page with Fetch API from Harvard
  Art Museum API. Here's example to get and print the data to console when
  page render for the first time

  ```jsx
  ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const getArts = () => {
      fetch(
        'https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/object?apikey=randomnumberhere&page=1',
      )
        .then(({info, records}) => {
          console.log(info)
          console.log(records)
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.log(err)
        })
    }

    getArts()
  }, [])
  ...
  ```

- **Learn to use React Hooks to manage data and state**

  I learned how to manage the data and state using useState and useEffect.
  Here's the example using useState and useEffect to get and save the data:

  ```jsx
  import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react'

  const Home = () => {
    // 1
    const [list, setList] = useState([{}])

    // 2
    useEffect(() => {
      const getArts = () => {
        fetch(
          'https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/object?apikey=randomnumberhere&page=1',
        )
          .then(({info, records}) => {
            // 3
            setList((arts) => [...arts, ...records])
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            console.log(err)
          })
      }

      getArts()
    }, [])

    return (
      <div>
        {list.length !== 0
          ? list.map((art) => {
              return <div>{art.title}</div>
            })
          : 'List is empty or not found'}
      </div>
    )
  }

  export default Home
  ```

  Explanation:

  1.  Initialize `list` as empty array of object using useState
  2.  Then run `getArts()` inside `useEffect(()=>, [])` to fetch data when
      page render for the first time, the second parameter `[]` in useEffect
      is to define how useEffect should run
  3.  After request is resolved, save the data using `setLists` so it can be
      render on the page

- **Use Reach Router to move to another page**

  I learned how to move to another page and to create dynamic page like
  `/details/:id` page

- **How to deploy Single Page Application in Surge.**

  How deploy to Surge:

  1.  `npm run build` to build application for production.
  2.  Copy your index.html to `build` folder and rename it to 200.html.
  3.  Execute `surge` command to deploy your application to Surge.sh.

So that's a couple of lesson that I learned when build this projects, it's a
simple project but I learned a quiet a lot about fundamental of React.
