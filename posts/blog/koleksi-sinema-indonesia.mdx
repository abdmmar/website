You can use Static Generation for many `types` of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot
pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently
updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but
the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering
and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
